Thanks for checking out the Echo Engine!</p><p>This engine uses SFML and ImGUI for the 2D side of things, and you can pick between Vulkan and DirectX12 for the 3D stuff, that also uses ImGUI!</p><p>Right now it's not released to the public. I say 2025 Q4 will be the release of the engine. I know it sounds like a long wait, but if you join the discord you can apply to be a beta tester!</p>"
